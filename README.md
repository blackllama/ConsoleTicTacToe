# ConsoleTicTacToe
A little console app to play Tic Tac Toe

## To Run
- Open the solution with Visual Studio and run the app OR
- Run the exe file in the root directory


### Still to do
- Write tests to cover:
  -   Atleast 3 winning cases (horizontal win, vertical win, diagonal win)
  -   Error state: input out of bounds of board
  -   Error state: Input not a coordinate pair
  -   Error state: Duplicate coordinate entered
  -   Error state: Invalid input
- Handle input validation more gracefully to allow for retry
- Add ability to restart the game
